### What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It extends JavaScript by adding optional static typing and powerful tooling support — enabling developers to write more robust and maintainable code. Since it builds on JavaScript, all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript.

Originally released in 2012, TypeScript has since become one of the most popular technologies for building large-scale frontend and backend applications. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any browser, Node.js, or JavaScript-based runtime.

### Why use TypeScript?
The goal of TypeScript is to catch errors before they reach production. By defining explicit types for variables, function arguments, and return values, TypeScript acts like a safety net for your codebase. It enhances editor support with powerful autocompletion, real-time feedback, and refactoring tools.

Whether you're building a small personal site or a mission-critical application, TypeScript scales with your project and team size — making it a favorite choice across industries.
