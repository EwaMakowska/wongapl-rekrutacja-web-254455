The `string` type in TypeScript is one of the primitive types and is used to work with textual data. You can assign any string value to a variable of type `string`.

### Example of usage

```typescript
let myName: string = "Alice";
let greeting: string = `Hello, ${myName}!`;
```

### Notes

- Strings can be enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).
- Template strings (using backticks `` ` ``) are also strings, and they allow for embedded expressions and multi-line text.
